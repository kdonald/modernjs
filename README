Sample code supporting my ModernJS talk.
----------------------------------------
key-concepts
  - little examples that illustrate key concept of the JS language

rewardnetwork-* - little reference app demonstrating multi-module development/structure
  basic: what stereotypical "script-kiddies" might do - pollutes the global namespace
  namespaced: better, but feels a little awkward
  modular: i <3 modules!
  
dom - basic dom manipulation example using jQuery API

ajax - basic ajax example showing traditional and new "deferred" style (jQuery)
       note the nasty in-line html (see templating example to address that).
       
templating - client-side templating example with Handlebars

mvc - illustrates mvc principles using my own little mvc.js framework inspired by
      Backbone and Agility.js (designed for educational purposes, not for product)
      Get Backbone.js at https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone (see Todos example)
